                    I am a computer science student eager to explore the different fields of the tech industry, starting with web development.
                    I am currently studying <a href="https://www.senecacollege.ca/programs/fulltime/CPA.html">Computer Programming and Analysis</a>
                    at Seneca College. I prevously studied Medicinal Chemistry at the University of Waterloo but did not see myself pursuing a career in the field.
                    Due to my analytical mindset, I took an interest in computer science and decided to change the focus of my studies. I switched my major to
                    a 3-year General Science program, graduated later that term, then applied to start college the following term. While this was a scary leap for me, it
                    was the best decision I have ever made. This was the biggest life choice of mine thus far and now I feel prepared for whatever life has to throw at me.

                        In the fall of 2021, I started my studies at Seneca. I completed my first semester where I was introduced to basic computer science principles. I was
                        taught the fundamentals of computational thinking, decomposition and abstraction. I learned to program through C and practiced using it in several workshops.
                        I was exposed to the terminology and concepts of the IT sector such as API's, version control, and the SDLC. Lastly, I studied the UNIX/LINUX operating system
                        and gained experience using practical file manipulating techniques.

                        I began my studies at the University of Waterloo in the fall of 2018 as a medicinal chemistry student. The focus of this specialized program was
                        organic chemistry, which I studied until the spring of 2021. That is when I switched into a 3-year General Science program and graduated with a Bachelor's Degree
                        before beginning my studies at Seneca. Organic chemistry as a whole is very analytical, there are several factors that affect how molecules interact
                        and when taken into account, the products can be accurately determined. I enjoyed this process and its similarities with computer science presented me with two career paths.
                        During my last term at Waterloo, I was able to take the cs course I wasn't able to before. After starting the course, I knew instantly I had made the right choice.
